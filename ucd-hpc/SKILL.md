description: Help people use the UC Davis HPC@UCD clusters Farm, Franklin, and Hive. Covers writing and fixing Slurm sbatch/srun job scripts with the right --account/--partition for that user (high vs preemptible low, GPU partitions, the free publicgrp tier and its per-job limits), requesting CPUs/memory/GPUs/time correctly, diagnosing pending or failed jobs (squeue reasons, sacct, OOM, TIMEOUT, preemption, QOS limits, "Invalid account or account/partition combination"), finding and loading software (environment modules on CVMFS, conda/mamba, Apptainer, R/RStudio, Jupyter, Open OnDemand), and storage and data transfer (20 GB home quota, /quobyte and /group PI shares, per-job scratch, Hive backups, rsync/Globus/scp). Use it whenever the user mentions farm, franklin, hive, hpc.ucdavis.edu, HPC@UCD, HPCCF, HiPPO, Quobyte, or Slurm/sbatch/srun/squeue/module on a UC Davis cluster, or is clearly working from a UC Davis login node, even if they never name the cluster or ask for a "job script".

# UC Davis HPC (Farm, Franklin, Hive)

Three clusters share one documentation set and support team but differ in partitions, limits,
free-tier rules, storage paths, and software trees. Most user pain is one cluster's assumptions
applied to another, so pin down the cluster and the user's accounts before anything else.

## Login-node discipline

You are on a shared login node, not a workstation. Ordinary users are capped per user at
**2 CPUs, 7.5% of RAM, 500 MB swap, 512 processes** (`/etc/security/systemd-user-limits.sh`,
applied by PAM at login) and 16,384 open files (`/etc/security/limits.d/slurm.conf`). Members
of `hpccfgrp` (HPCCF staff) are exempt — the script deletes their limits — so
`id -nG | grep -qw hpccfgrp` says whether the caps apply to *your* account. **Never infer the
policy from your own cgroup**: a staff account sees `infinity` everywhere, but the caps are real
for the people you are helping, and staff kill processes that degrade the node regardless.
Exempt from enforcement is not permission.

- **No analysis on the login node.** Compiles, data crunching, large conda solves,
  `apptainer build`, indexing — anything past a few seconds of CPU or much I/O — runs in `srun`
  (blocking) or `sbatch`, and you wait. Waiting for the scheduler is the correct behavior, not a
  delay to engineer around.
- **Do not game the caps**: no `nice`/`ionice`, no splitting or backgrounding work to stay under
  the limits, no parallel `find` or transfer streams, no `ulimit`. If it does not fit
  comfortably, it belongs in a job.
- **Bound every `find`**: `-maxdepth 2` or less on a login node, from a narrow starting
  directory. Deeper walks go in a job and you wait:
  `srun -A ACC -p PART -t 15 --mem=2G find /quobyte/PIGRP -maxdepth 6 -name '*.bam'`.
  Prefer a targeted lookup to a walk — `module avail NAME` for software (never `find` for a
  binary), `sacct -j ID --format=WorkDir%200` for a job's logs, `df -h`/`qinfo quota PATH` for
  space, `du -sh` on a suspect directory rather than a share. If a full inventory is really
  needed, produce it once in a job, write it to a file, and read the file.
- **Slurm commands are at a fixed path on all three clusters**, never something to search for:
  `/cvmfs/hpc.ucdavis.edu/sw/spack/environments/core/view/generic/slurm/bin/`.
  `sinfo: command not found` in a non-interactive shell means run
  `source /etc/profile.d/modules.sh` or prepend that directory to `PATH`.
- Interactive work runs inside `tmux`; look inside a running job with
  `srun --jobid=ID --overlap --pty bash -l` (direct `ssh node` is not allowed).

## Workflow

1. **Identify the cluster.** `cat /opt/hpccf/etc/cluster_name.conf` → `farm`, `franklin`, or
   `hive`. If you are off-cluster or the user is asking about a cluster you are not on, say so
   plainly and work from `references/<cluster>.md`; you can still hand them commands to run there.

2. **Gather live context.** Run `scripts/cluster-context.sh` (read-only, ~10 s). It prints the
   user's accounts, partitions and QOS caps, each partition's time limit and default memory per
   CPU, GPU types, storage paths and quota, module trees, and whether the login caps apply to
   this account. Read it before choosing `--account`, `--partition`, memory, or GPU flags: many
   users have no default account, limits live in per-QOS records you cannot see otherwise (Hive's
   free tier is 8 CPUs / 128 GB / 1 GPU per job; a PI pool may be 1024 CPUs), and default memory
   per CPU is 2 GB on Farm/Franklin, 4 GB on Hive `high`, 16 GB on Hive GPU partitions.
   Off-cluster, ask the user to paste
   `sacctmgr show assoc user=$USER format=account%20,partition%20,qos%40` or the
   `/opt/hpccf/bin/slurm-show-resources.py` table printed at every login.

3. **Read the cluster file plus the task file** (each is short):

   | Need | Read |
   |------|------|
   | Partitions, limits, GPUs, storage paths, quirks of *this* cluster | `references/hive.md` / `farm.md` / `franklin.md` |
   | sbatch/srun/salloc, arrays, MPI, GPUs, resource semantics | `references/slurm.md` |
   | Pending reasons, submission errors, OOM/TIMEOUT/PREEMPTED, logs, OnDemand failures | `references/debugging.md` |
   | Modules, conda, Apptainer, R/RStudio, Jupyter, requesting software | `references/software.md` |
   | Home vs group storage, scratch, quotas, Quobyte rules, backups, transfer | `references/storage.md` |

4. **Do the task.** Write scripts to real files, explain each `#SBATCH` line the first time
   (assume the user may not know Slurm), and prefer commands the user can rerun themselves.

5. **Verify before handing over.**
   - `scripts/lint-jobscript.sh FILE` checks for missing `--account`/`--partition`/`--time`/memory
     and unitless sizes, free-tier caps, `%j`/`%A_%a` in output names, `--exclusive`, `module`
     without `modules.sh`, `conda activate` without `module load conda`, hard-coded thread
     counts, and scratch without copy-out, then runs `sbatch --test-only` and reports
     accept/reject (it hides the "to start at" time on purpose — see the rules). Fix what it flags.
   - `scripts/job-postmortem.sh JOBID` pulls `sacct`/`scontrol`, computes memory and CPU use
     against the request, finds and greps the logs, and states the likely cause.
   - Never assert that software exists or does not without `module avail NAME`,
     `module search NAME`, and `module -t avail conda/`.

## Rules on all three clusters

- **Set `--account`, `--partition`, `--time`, and memory explicitly**; defaults differ per cluster
  and no partition has a default time. `low` allows 7 days (Farm, Hive) or 14 (Franklin); `high`
  allows 150 / 60 / 30 days on Farm / Franklin / Hive.
- **`low` is preemptible** (`PreemptMode=REQUEUE`): an owner's `high` job kills it and it
  restarts from the top. Recommend it only for short, restartable, or checkpointed work, and say
  that this is the price of free access.
- **Threads vs tasks**: one multithreaded program is `--ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=N`; MPI or many
  processes is `--ntasks=N`. SMT rounds odd CPU counts up. Pass `$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK` to the
  program instead of hard-coding threads.
- **Memory is enforced by cgroups**; over the request the step dies as `OUT_OF_MEMORY`. Give a
  unit (`--mem=32G`, `--mem-per-cpu=4G`); a bare number is megabytes.
- **GPUs**: `--gpus=1` for any GPU, `--gpus=TYPE:1` for a model; list types with
  `sinfo -p PART -o "%G|%D" -h`. Franklin GPUs are untyped — pick nodes with
  `--constraint=amd|intel`. Apptainer needs `--nv`.
- **One writer per file on Quobyte** (all of Hive's group storage, Farm `/quobyte` shares): two
  nodes appending to one file hangs the node and gets accounts locked. `--output`/`--error`
  always carry `%j` (`%A_%a` for arrays, plus `%N` when multi-node), and array tasks or MPI ranks
  never share a result file.
- **`module` in job scripts** is not inherited from a zsh or scrubbed submit environment: start
  with `source /etc/profile.d/modules.sh` (or `#!/bin/bash -l`). `module purge` also drops
  `slurm`; reload it before calling `srun`.
- **Never recommend `--exclusive` on Hive** (it never schedules and shows a bogus
  `QOSGrpCpuLimit`); avoid it elsewhere unless the group owns whole nodes.
- **`sbatch --test-only` does not estimate the wait.** Its "to start at HH:MM" comes from one
  scheduler pass — identical for 1 or 48 CPUs, often hours ahead of an idle partition. Use it
  only for accept/reject. Queue health is `sinfo -p PART -h -o "%C"` (alloc/idle/other/total
  CPUs) and `squeue -t PD -h -o "%r" | sort | uniq -c`; pending reasons that are all `QOSGrp*`,
  `Dependency`, or `JobArrayTaskLimit` mean nothing is queued ahead of *you*.
- **Home is 20 GB** everywhere and is the usual cause of `Disk quota exceeded`; conda
  environments and every package cache belong on group storage.
- **`rsync --delete` destroys data**; include it only for an explicit mirror, and spell out the
  trailing-slash semantics.
- **Say what you could not verify** and give the command that would. Do not invent partition
  names, QOS limits, or module versions.

## Canonical job script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=myjob
#SBATCH --account=PIGRP              # from cluster-context.sh; publicgrp = free tier
#SBATCH --partition=high             # or low (preemptible), or a GPU partition
#SBATCH --time=1-00:00:00            # D-HH:MM:SS, under the partition max
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8            # threads for one program
#SBATCH --mem=32G                    # or --mem-per-cpu=4G
#SBATCH --output=myjob-%j.out        # %j: required on Quobyte
#SBATCH --error=myjob-%j.err

source /etc/profile.d/modules.sh     # `module` regardless of submit shell
module load samtools/1.19.2          # exact versions from `module avail`

cd "$SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR"
samtools sort -@ "$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK" -o out.bam in.bam
```

Add `--gpus=1` (with a GPU partition or `low`) for GPUs, `--array=1-N%20` for arrays, and
`--ntasks=N --nodes=1-4 --constraint='(zen2|zen3|zen4)'` for MPI on Hive.
